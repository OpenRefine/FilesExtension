# Files extension E2E tests

Inspired from [OpenRefine's own Cypress test suite](https://openrefine.org/docs/technical-reference/functional-tests)

Install the dependencies with `yarn install`.

Run the test suite with `yarn run cypress open`.

This requires a running instance of OpenRefine with the FilesExtension installed at `http://localhost:3333/`.
